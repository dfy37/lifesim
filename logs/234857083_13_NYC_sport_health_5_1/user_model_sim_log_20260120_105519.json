A fitted, moisture-wicking top with a secure neckline is also key, so it doesn’t slide over your head. Seamless or flat-seam designs help prevent irritation from the silks.

Athleta’s Salutation and Elation tops usually have secure, higher necklines and built-in bras for extra hold.

Look for versions with wide, non-slip bands at the bottom and seamless construction to avoid chafing. Pairing one with high-waisted leggings can give you full torso stability.

Look for high-waisted leggings with a good amount of compression—they’ll stay in place better during poses. A fitted, moisture-wicking top with a secure neckline is also key, so it doesn’t slide over your head. Seamless or flat-seam designs help prevent irritation from the silks.

They’re typically made from breathable, four-way stretch fabrics like nylon-spandex blends, so they stay comfortable even during sweaty, hour-long sessions. Look for versions with wide, non-slip bands at the bottom and seamless construction to avoid chafing. Pairing one with high-waisted leggings can give you full torso stability.
