      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "For aerial yoga, you’ll want clothes that are snug, breathable, and won’t ride up or slip when you’re inverted. Look for high-waisted leggings with a good amount of compression—they’ll stay in place better during poses. A fitted, moisture-wicking top with a secure neckline is also key, so it doesn’t slide over your head. Seamless or flat-seam designs help prevent irritation from the silks. Brands like Lululemon or Athleta often have lines tailored for dynamic movement. Do you prefer certain materials or a particular budget range?"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, both have specific tops designed for stability. Lululemon’s Align and Invigorate collections often feature racerback or keyhole-back designs that stay put upside down. Athleta’s Salutation and Elation tops usually have secure, higher necklines and built-in bras for extra hold. For absolute security, you might also consider a cropped, longline bra-top or a unitard—both minimize shifting during inversions. Would you like details on any of those styles?"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Longline bra-tops are designed with extended torso coverage, which helps distribute pressure evenly and prevents rolling up during inversions. They’re typically made from breathable, four-way stretch fabrics like nylon-spandex blends, so they stay comfortable even during sweaty, hour-long sessions. Look for versions with wide, non-slip bands at the bottom and seamless construction to avoid chafing. Pairing one with high-waisted leggings can give you full torso stability. Brands like Athleta’s Conscious Crop or Lululemon’s Energy Longline Bra are popular choices. Would you like specific care tips to maintain their fit over time?"

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Prioritize tops with racerback or cross-back straps—they lock shoulders in place better than standard straps. Look for a wide, elasticized band under the bust and along the hem to prevent rolling. Fabric-wise, seek out compressive, moisture-wicking blends with at least 15–20% spandex for grip. Flat-lock seams and bonded edges also reduce slippage and irritation. Some tops even have silicone gripper strips along the inner hem for extra security. Brands like Lululemon’s Swiftly Tech line and Athleta’s Ultimate line often include these features. Would you like recommendations based on your typical size or fit preference?"
