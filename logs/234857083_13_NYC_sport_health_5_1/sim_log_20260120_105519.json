This approach ensures both emotional and functional needs are met, fostering a more supportive and engaging interaction that aligns with users' full intent."

From the start of interactions, when discussing topics like injury prevention or gear, the assistant should use accurate terminology—for example, when recommending shoes for uneven terrain, explicitly mention features like 'enhanced traction,' 'stable midsole,' or 'secure fit' instead of vague terms like 'ankle support.' Additionally, to better align with implicit intents, the assistant should proactively ask follow-up questions about preventive measures, such as inquiring, 'Would you like specific tips to avoid similar injuries in the future?'
