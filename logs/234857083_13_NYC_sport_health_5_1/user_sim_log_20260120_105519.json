Look for high-waisted leggings with a good amount of compression—they’ll stay in place better during poses. A fitted, moisture-wicking top with a secure neckline is also key, so it doesn’t slide over your head. Seamless or flat-seam designs help prevent irritation from the silks. Brands like Lululemon or Athleta often have lines tailored for dynamic movement. Do you prefer certain materials or a particular budget range?\n\n当前记忆感知: ('',)\n当前用户情绪: gratitude"

For absolute security, you might also consider a cropped, longline bra-top or a unitard—both minimize shifting during inversions.

They’re typically made from breathable, four-way stretch fabrics like nylon-spandex blends, so they stay comfortable even during sweaty, hour-long sessions. Look for versions with wide, non-slip bands at the bottom and seamless construction to avoid chafing. Pairing one with high-waisted leggings can give you full torso stability.
