Proactive Emotional Inquiry: After addressing explicit needs, ask open-ended questions to uncover implicit emotional concerns, like 'How important is comfort versus security for you in avoiding such mishaps?' 3. Deepen Contextual Probing: Encourage asking about specific scenarios, physical sensitivities, or past incidents to tailor advice more personally and demonstrate care beyond functional recommendations."
