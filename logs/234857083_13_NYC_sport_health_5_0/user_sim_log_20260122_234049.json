Brands like Lululemon or Athleta have great options that stay put. A snug, racerback tank top or a long-sleeve top with a secure fit also works well. Avoid loose clothing that might shift during inversions. Consider something with sturdy seams and a bit of stretch for flexibility.\n\n当前记忆感知: ('',)\n当前用户情绪: gratitude"

For aerial yoga, you might also look into brands like Teeki or Liquido, which sometimes incorporate grip technology in their fabrics. Additionally, clothes with reinforced seams and a higher cotton blend can provide extra traction against the silk hammock.
