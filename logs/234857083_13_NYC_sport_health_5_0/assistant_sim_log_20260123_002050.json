Athleta's Salutation Stash Pocket leggings are also popular for their compression and no-slip waistband. Beyond Yoga's Spacedye sets often have a textured fabric that grips well during movement. Many of these come with subtle silicone strips inside the seams for extra hold. Would you like to try any of these in person, or need help with sizing?"

A good fit is crucial; make sure there's a thumb's width of space at the toe and the heel doesn't slip. It's best to try them on later in the day when your feet are naturally a bit swollen. Once your ankle feels better, visiting a specialty running store for a fitting could be really helpful."
