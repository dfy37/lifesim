      "content": "For Lululemon, many of their styles are designed to fit snugly for support, so sticking with your true size is usually best—though some prefer to size up for comfort in looser styles. Athleta tends to run true to size and offers a good range of fits. I'd suggest trying items on if possible, since fit can vary by style!"
