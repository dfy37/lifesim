Do you know if their clothes run true to size, or should I size up or down for a better fit?\nAssistant: For Lululemon, many of their styles are designed to fit snugly for support, so sticking with your true size is usually best—though some prefer to size up for comfort in looser styles. Athleta tends to run true to size and offers a good range of fits. I'd suggest trying items on if possible, since fit can vary by style!\n### User Memory Perception\n('',)\n### Candidate Emotions\nadmiration,amusement,anger,annoyance,approval,caring,confusion,curiosity,desire,disappointment,disapproval,disgust,embarrassment,excitement,fear,gratitude,grief,joy,love,nervousness,optimism,pride,realization,relief,remorse,sadness,surprise,neutral\n\n### Requirements\n- Output in the following JSON format, enclosed between ```json and ```:\n```json\n{\n  \"emotion\": \"xxx\"\n}\n```\nWhere:\n- emotion: The emotion of the user's next reply, selected from the candidate emotions.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```json\n{\n  \"emotion\": \"gratitude\"\n}\n```"}]
