    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Sure! For aerial yoga, look for high-waisted leggings with a compressive fit, preferably made of moisture-wicking fabric. Brands like Lululemon or Athleta have great options that stay put. A snug, racerback tank top or a long-sleeve top with a secure fit also works well. Avoid loose clothing that might shift during inversions. Consider something with sturdy seams and a bit of stretch for flexibility."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, some brands offer leggings with silicone grip patterns on the waistband or along the seams to prevent slipping. For aerial yoga, you might also look into brands like Teeki or Liquido, which sometimes incorporate grip technology in their fabrics. Additionally, clothes with reinforced seams and a higher cotton blend can provide extra traction against the silk hammock. Would you like me to suggest specific styles or stores that carry these?"

      "content": "The Lululemon Wunder Under High-Rise Tight in Luxtreme fabric is a great choice—it’s designed to stay put during movement and has a secure, slip-resistant fit. The fabric offers light compression and smooth coverage, which helps with aerial poses. For tops, the Swiftly Tech Long-Sleeve or Racerback in a snug fit works well to avoid shifting. I’d recommend trying them in-store if possible to check the feel and grip."

Land softly with a midfoot strike rather than heel-striking, and keep your steps light and quick to adjust easily. That can help reduce strain on your ankles. For now, though, focus on letting your ankle recover completely."
